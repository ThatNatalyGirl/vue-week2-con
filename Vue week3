Vue week3

Component:

A component is anything - and html element can be made into a component and then can be reuseable

A module is a component

A todo item was a component
	-it had some data
	-managed it's own DOM stuff
	-it was a component that lived inside another components

	ITS LIKE A RUSSIAN DOLL

		-little components inside of bigger components inside of a giant component

The beauty of the component is 
	-type field can have something special about it 
		-a special feature
	-You don't have to remember how you did it. 
	-You can just use it over and over again

Take Facebook for instance**
					-The center feed is one component
					-Each post is one component
					-If it's different people they can trust the person wrote it right and just use it
					-There's more components
						-the like component
						-the comment component 
						-etc

with a component you don't put anything in the html 
the html stuff goes in the template	
	- you name it and then you put it in the file when you have one

Starting out

<div id="app">
	{{message}}
</div>
`````````````````````````
var app = new Vue({
	el: "#app",
	data: {
		message: 'hello vue'
	}
})


data goes down
events go up
